# Scaling Data Pipelines

Spring Cloud Data Flow provides a dedicated, [Scale API](%currentPath%/feature-guides/streams/scaling/), designed for scaling data pipelines. The API can be used to implement scaling characteristics based on application business logic. Developers can implement an auto-scale controller and reuse it with Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry or even with the Local platform for local testing purposes.

Find below recipes about how to scale applications using SCDF Shell or implement autoscale streaming data pipelines.
