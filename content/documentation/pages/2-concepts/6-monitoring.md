# Monitoring

The Data Flow monitoring architecture helps to deliver application metrics critical to the health and performance of the server infrastructure and the deployed stream and task pipelines.

Designed around the Micrometer library the Data Flow monitoring supports some of the most popular monitoring systems, such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Wavefront](https://www.wavefront.com/) and [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/).

[Wavefront](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_introduction.html) is a high-performance streaming analytics platform that supports 3D observability (metrics, histograms, traces/spans). It scales to very high data ingestion rates and query loads while also collecting data many services and sources across your entire application stack.

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a popular pull-based Time Series Database that pulls the metrics from the target applications with pre-configured endpoints and provides a query language to select and aggregate time series data in real time.

<!--NOTE-->

The Data Flow architecture employs the [Prometheus-RSocket-Proxy](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/prometheus-rsocket-proxy) to provide an uniform support of both `long-lived` (streams) and `short-lived` (tasks) applications.

<!--END_NOTE-->

[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is a popular open-source push-based Time Series Database. It supports downsampling, automatically expiring and deleting unwanted data, and backup and restore. Analysis of data is done through an SQL-like query language.

The Data Flow allows you to declaratively select and configure which monitoring system to use. Just apply the Spring Boot [metrics configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-metrics-getting-started) to enable and configure the Data Flow monitoring support. Usually you will add the following configurations to your Data Flow and Skipper server configurations:

```
management.metrics.export.<your-meter-registry>.enabled=true // <1>
management.metrics.export.<your-meter-registry>.<meter-specific-properties>=... // <2>
```

- <1> Replace the `<your-meter-registry>` with either, `influx`, `wavefront` or `prometheus`. (Note: in case of prometheus enable the prometheus-rsocket-proxy as well: `management.metrics.export.prometheus.rsocket.enabled=true`).

- <2> Use the Spring Boot/Micrometer meter specific configurations provided for [Wavefront](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-metrics-export-wavefront), [InfluxDB](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-metrics-export-influx) and [Prometheus](Spring Boot Actuator: Production-ready Features)/[RSocket-Proxy](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/prometheus-rsocket-proxy).

By default the Micrometer configuration is reused for both the server infrastructure and the data pipeline monitoring.

To help you get started, Data Flow provides [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [Wavefront](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_dashboards.html) dashboards that you can customize.

You can also opt for the [Wavefront Data Flow SaaS](https://www.wavefront.com/integrations/scdf) tile.

For detailed information on how to set up the monitoring infrastructure follow the following feature guides:
