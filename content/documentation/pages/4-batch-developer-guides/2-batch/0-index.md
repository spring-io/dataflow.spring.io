This section will cover the basics of creating a Spring Cloud Task application as well as a Spring Batch Application that can be deployed stand-alone or using Spring Cloud Data Flow to platforms such as Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, or a local instance.

The sample business case that this section will support will be one of a cell phone company that needs to run an application that will generate the billing statements for their customers.
We address the business case in two applications, one to prepare the database and one to generate the billing statement.
