# Batch Development

This section covers the basics of creating a Spring Cloud Task application as well as a Spring Batch Application (which can be deployed stand-alone or by using Spring Cloud Data Flow) to Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, or a local instance.

The sample business case that this section supports is one of a cell phone company that needs to run an application to generate billing statements for their customers.
We address the business case in two applications: one to prepare the database and one to generate the billing statement.
