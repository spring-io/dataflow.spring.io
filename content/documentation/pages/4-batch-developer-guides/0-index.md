# Developer guides

There are several guides in this section, but a common starting path through them consists of the following steps

1. Follow the Getting Started guide, which shows you how to use the **prebuilt applications** to create and deploy a task with Spring Cloud Data Flow.  
   This gives you a quick feel for how to use the Dashboard to create a stream, deploy it, and look at the logs.

1. Develop your own task with Spring Cloud Task, deploy it manually to a platform, and dive into what is happening on the platform.

1. Take the task application you just developed, register it with Spring Cloud Data Flow, and then deploy it to the platform.
